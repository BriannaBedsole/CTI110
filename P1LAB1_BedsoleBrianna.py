#In this project we use basic python commands such as input and print to create a program. Our commands should allow us to enter our first name then last, along with a message that displays the first name and last name entered.

first_name = input("Enter Your First Name: ")
last_name = input("Enter Your Last Name: ")
print(f"Hello, {first_name} {last_name}! Welcome to CTI-110")
